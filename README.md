# CU Grade Guide

Project with the goal of allowing users to view grade distribution data for any given class at Clemson University. 
The data used to create this project is publicly available in PDF format. The data used to create the .pkl files comes from .csv files which are not publicly available.

This repository includes:
- The .csv data
- A python script which parses the .csv files and creates .pkl files
- A python program which takes the .pkl data and formats it for use by the website

_Note: the website is not included in this collection of files related to CU Grade Guide_

__This was created at the 12 hour Hello World Freshman Hackathon (10/13/18) hosted by Clemson University's "CU Hack It"__
